# Cookbook

A cookbook contains a collection of useful patterns for solving common problems in front-end development.

For example:
- How do I build a modal dialog popup in Qwik?

## Manual serialization

Qwik has built-in serialization/deserialization from the server to the client that covers most cases. From time to time, you may need to return something from a loader or an action that Qwik can't (yet!) serialize. For these cases, you can use a serialization library to handle this manually.

> An API for adding your own custom serializers is on our roadmap, too. This recipe is intended to tide you over until this feature explodes onto the scene.

In this Recipe, we'll use [Superjson](https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson), a popular serialization library.

Install Superjson with:

```ts
npm install superjson
```

Now, say you want to return an instance of `MyCustomClass` from a `routeLoader$`. Here's how you'd do it:

```tsx
import { component$, useVisibleTask$ } from "@builder.io/qwik";
import { routeLoader$, type DocumentHead } from "@builder.io/qwik-city";
import superjson from 'superjson';

class MyCustomClass {
  constructor({name}: {name: string}) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  name: string;
}

export const useDataLoader = routeLoader$(() => {
  const instance = new MyCustomClass({name: "Mr. Foo"});
  const jsonString = superjson.stringify(instance);
  return jsonString;
});

export default component$(() => {
  const dataLoader = useDataLoader();

  return (
    <>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify((superjson.parse(dataLoader.value) as typeof MyCustomClass).name}</pre>
    </>
  );
});
```

Notice how we cast the return value of
